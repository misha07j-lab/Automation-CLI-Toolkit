\# 🚀 Automation CLI Toolkit



A modular collection of production-ready CLI tools designed for automation, data processing, and predictable system integration in Windows environments.



Automation CLI Toolkit provides standardized behavior, unified exit codes, and consistent architecture across all tools — enabling clean integration into CI/CD pipelines, scripts, and operational workflows.



All tools are aligned with Studio CLI Contract v1.0.

\## 🎯 Philosophy



The toolkit is built around three principles:



\- Predictability – Stable CLI behavior and standardized exit codes

\- Modularity – Each tool is an independent production brick

\- Consistency – Unified contract, architecture, and release structure



This is not a collection of utilities.

It is a structured CLI ecosystem.

\## 📊 Unified Exit Codes (Studio CLI Contract v1.0)



| Code | Meaning |

|------|----------|

| 0    | Success |

| 1    | Invalid arguments |

| 10   | File not found |

| 20   | Processing error |

| 99   | Unhandled exception |



All tools in the toolkit follow this contract.

\## 🖥 Platform



\- Windows 10 / 11

\- PowerShell 5+

\- CMD

\- CI/CD environments

\- Self-contained single-file builds (win-x64)



---



\## 🏗 Architecture



Each tool follows:



\- Clean separation of CLI and Core logic

\- Explicit exit code mapping

\- Deterministic error handling pipeline

\- Release structure aligned across repositories

\- Self-contained production builds



The toolkit evolves incrementally — each tool strengthens the ecosystem.



---



\## 🔮 Roadmap



Planned production bricks:



\- Data Cleaner

\- API Integration CLI

\- Log Analyzer Extensions

\- Aggregation modules

\- Unified Automation Studio layer



---



\## 📌 Versioning Strategy



\- Patch (v1.0.x) → Stability and refinements

\- Minor (v1.x.0) → Feature expansion

\- Major (v2.0.0) → Contract evolution



---



\## 📦 Release Standard



Each tool release includes:



\- Product positioning

\- Quick Start examples

\- Exit Code table

\- Compatibility section

\- Self-contained build

\- SHA256 checksum



Automation CLI Toolkit is designed for long-term architectural growth, not short-term experimentation.
